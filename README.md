Dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements or homogeneous regions. For most 
applications and down-stream tasks, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is 
crucial to know **when and where** to trust the estimated matches. 
In this work, we aim to estimate a dense flow field relating two images, coupled with a robust pixel-wise 
confidence map indicating the reliability and accuracy of the prediction. We develop a flexible probabilistic 
approach that jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize the predictive 
distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. 
Moreover, we develop an architecture and training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty 
prediction in the context of self-supervised training. 


### GOCor: Bringing Globally Optimized Correspondence Volumes into Your Neural Network. (NeurIPS 2020)
Authors: [Prune Truong](https://prunetruong.com/) *, [Martin Danelljan](https://martin-danelljan.github.io/) *, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte<br />

\[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07823)\]

\[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22MyFChBCs)\]


The feature correlation layer serves as a key neural network module in numerous computer vision problems that
involve dense correspondences between image pairs. It predicts a correspondence volume by evaluating dense scalar products 
between feature vectors extracted from pairs of locations in two images. However, this point-to-point feature comparison 
is insufficient when disambiguating multiple similar regions in an image, severely affecting the performance of 
the end task. 
**This work proposes GOCor, a fully differentiable dense matching module, acting as a direct replacement to 
the feature correlation layer.** The correspondence volume generated by our module is the result of an internal 
optimization procedure that explicitly accounts for similar regions in the scene. Moreover, our approach is 
capable of effectively learning spatial matching priors to resolve further matching ambiguities.

## 1. Installation <a name="Installation"></a>

Inference runs for torch version >= 1.0

* Create and activate conda environment with Python 3.x

```bash
conda create -n dense_matching_env python=3.7
conda activate dense_matching_env
```

* Install all dependencies (except for cupy, see below) by running the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision matplotlib imageio jpeg4py scipy pandas tqdm gdown pycocotools
```

**Note**: CUDA is required to run the code. Indeed, the correlation layer is implemented in CUDA using CuPy, 
which is why CuPy is a required dependency. It can be installed using pip install cupy or alternatively using one of the 
provided binary packages as outlined in the CuPy repository. The code was developed using Python 3.7 & PyTorch 1.0 & CUDA 9.0, 
which is why I installed cupy for cuda90. For another CUDA version, change accordingly. 

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda90==7.8.0 --no-cache-dir 
```

There are some issues with latest versions of cupy. So for all cuda, install cupy version 7.8.0. For example, on cuda10, 
```bash
pip install cupy-cuda100==7.8.0 --no-cache-dir 
```

* This repo includes [GOCor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07823) as git submodule. 
You need to pull submodules with 
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

* Create admin/local.py by running the following command and update the paths to the dataset. 
We provide an example admin/local_example.py where all datasets are stored in data/. 
```bash
python -c "from admin.environment import create_default_local_file; create_default_local_file()"
```

* **Download pre-trained model weights** with the command ```bash assets/download_pre_trained_models.sh```. 

<br />

## 2. Test on your own image pairs!  <a name="Test"></a>

Possible model choices are : PDCNet, GLUNet_GOCor_star, GLUNet, GLUNet_GOCor, PWCNet, PWCNet_GOCor

Possible pre-trained model choices are: static, dynamic, chairs_things, chairs_things_ft_sintel, megadepth

  <summary><b>Note on PDCNet inference options</b></summary>

PDC-Net has multiple inference alternative options. 
if model is PDC-Net, add options:  
* --confidence_map_R, for computation of the confidence map p_r, default is 1.0
* --multi_stage_type in 
    * 'direct' (D)
    * 'homography_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty' (H)
    * 'multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty' (MS)
* --ransac_thresh, used for homography and multiscale multi-stages type, default is 1.0
* --mask_type, for thresholding the estimated confidence map and using the confident matches for internal homography estimation, for 
homography and multiscale multi-stage types, default is proba_interval_1_above_5
* --homography_visibility_mask, default is True
* --scaling_factors', used for multi-scale, default are \[0.5, 0.6, 0.88, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2\]

Use direct (D) when image pairs only show limited view-point changes (for example consecutive images of a video, 
like in the optical flow task). For larger view-point changes, use homography (H) or multi-scale (MS). 


For example, to run PDC-Net with multi-scale, add at the end of the command
```bash
PDCNet --multi_stage_type multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty --mask_type proba_interval_1_above_10
```

</details>


### Test on a specific image pair 


You can test the networks on a pair of images using test_models.py and the provided trained model weights. 
You must first choose the model and pre-trained weights to use. 
The inputs are the paths to the query and reference images. 
The images are then passed to the network which outputs the corresponding flow field relating the reference to the query image. 
The query is then warped according to the estimated flow, and a figure is saved. 

<br />

For this pair of MegaDepth images (provided to check that the code is working properly) and using **PDCNet** (MS) 
trained on the megadepth dataset, the output is:

```bash
python test_models.py --model PDCNet --pre_trained_model megadepth --path_query_image images/piazza_san_marco_0.jpg --path_reference_image images/piazza_san_marco_1.jpg --write_dir evaluation/ PDCNet --multi_stage_type multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty --mask_type proba_interval_1_above_10
```
additional optional arguments: --pre_trained_models_dir (default is pre_trained_models/)
![alt text](/images/Warped_query_image_PDCNet_megadepth.png)


<br />

Using **GLU-Net-GOCor** trained on the dynamic dataset, the output for this image pair of eth3d is:

```bash
python test_models.py --model GLUNet_GOCor --pre_trained_model dynamic --path_query_image images/eth3d_query.png --path_reference_image images/eth3d_reference.png --write_dir evaluation/
```
![alt text](/images/eth3d_warped_query_image_GLUNet_GOCor_dynamic.png)

<br />

For baseline **GLU-Net**, the output is instead:

```bash
python test_models.py --model GLUNet --pre_trained_model dynamic --path_query_image images/eth3d_query.png --path_reference_image images/eth3d_reference.png --write_dir evaluation/

```
![alt text](/images/eth3d_warped_query_image_GLUNet_dynamic.png)


<br />

And for **PWC-Net-GOCor** and baseline **PWC-Net**:


```bash
python test_models.py --model PWCNet_GOCor --pre_trained_model chairs_things --path_query_image images/kitti2015_query.png --path_reference_image images/kitti2015_reference.png --write_dir evaluation/
```

![alt text](/images/kitti2015_warped_query_image_PWCNet_GOCor_chairs_things.png)

<br />

```bash
python test_models.py --model PWCNet --pre_trained_model chairs_things --path_query_image images/kitti2015_query.png --path_reference_image images/kitti2015_reference.png --write_dir evaluation/
```

## 3. Overview  <a name="overview"></a>

The framework consists of the following sub-modules.

* training: 
    * actors: Contains the actor classes for different trainings. The actor class is responsible for passing the input 
    data through the network and calculating losses. 
    Here are also pre-processing classes, that process batch tensor inputs to the desired inputs needed for training the network. 
    * trainers: The main class which runs the training.
    * losses: Contain the loss classes 
* train_settings: Contains settings files, specifying the training of a network.
* admin: Includes functions for loading networks, tensorboard etc. and also contains environment settings.
* datasets: Contains integration of a number of datasets. Additionally, it includes modules to generate 
synthetic image pairs and their corresponding ground-truth flow as well as to add independently moving objects 
and modify the flow accordingly. 
* utils_data: Contains functions for processing data, e.g. loading images, data augmentations, sampling frames.
* utils_flow: Contains functions for working with flow fields, e.g. converting to mapping, warping an array according 
to a flow, as well as visualization tools. 
* third_party: External libraries needed for training. Added as submodules.
* models: Contains different layers and network definitions.
* validation: Contains functions to evaluate and analyze the performance of the networks in terms of predicted 
flow and uncertainty. 



## 4. Benchmark and results  <a name="Results"></a>

All paths to the datasets must be provided in file admin/local.py. 
We provide an example admin/local_example.py where all datasets are stored in data/. 
You need to update the paths of admin/local.py before running the evaluation.

  <summary><b>Note on PDCNet inference options</b></summary>

PDC-Net has multiple inference alternative options. 
if model if PDC-Net, add options:  
* --confidence_map_R, for computation of the confidence map p_r, default is 1.0
* --multi_stage_type in 
    * 'direct' (D)
    * 'homography_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty' (H)
    * 'multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty' (MS)
* --ransac_thresh, used for homography and multiscale multi-stages type, default is 1.0
* --mask_type, for thresholding the estimated confidence map and using the confident matches for internal homography estimation, for 
homography and multiscale multi-stage types, default is proba_interval_1_above_5
* --homography_visibility_mask, default is True
* --scaling_factors', used for multi-scale, default are \[0.5, 0.6, 0.88, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2\]

For example, to run PDC-Net with multi-scale, add at the end of the command
```bash
PDCNet --multi_stage_type multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty --mask_type proba_interval_1_above_10
```

</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>Note on reproducibility</b></summary>

Results using PDC-Net with multi-stage (homography_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty, H) or multi-scale 
(multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty, MS) employ RANSAC internally. Therefore results may vary a bit but should remain within 1-2 %.
For pose estimation, we also compute the pose with RANSAC, which leads to some variability in the results.  
  
</details>

### 4.1. Correspondence evaluation <a name="correspondence_eval"></a>

Metrics are computed with, 
```bash
python -u eval_matching.py --datasets dataset_name --model model_name --pre_trained_models pre_trained_model_name --optim_iter optim_step  --local_optim_iter local_optim_iter --save_dir path_to_save_dir --plot False 
```


<details>
  <summary><b>MegaDepth</b><a name="megadepth"></a></summary>


**Data preparation**: We use the test set provided in [RANSAC-Flow](https://github.com/XiSHEN0220/RANSAC-Flow/tree/master/evaluation/evalCorr). 
It is composed of 1600 pairs and  also includes a csv file ('test1600Pairs.csv') containing 
the name of image pairs to evaluate and the corresponding ground-truth correspondences. 
Download everything with 
```bash
bash assets/download_megadepth_test.sh
```

The resulting file structure is the following
```bash
megadepth_test_set/
└── MegaDepth/
    └── Test/
        └── test1600Pairs/  
        └── test1600Pairs.csv
```

<br /><br />
**Evaluation**: After updating the path of 'megadepth' and 'megadepth_csv' in admin/local.py, evaluation is run with
```bash
python eval_matching.py --datasets megadepth --model PDCNet --pre_trained_models megadepth --optim_iter 3 --local_optim_iter 7 --save_dir path_to_save_dir PDCNet --multi_stage_type multiscale_homo_from_quarter_resolution_uncertainty
```

**Data preparation**: execute 'bash assets/download_ETH3D.sh' from our [GLU-Net repo](https://github.com/PruneTruong/GLU-Net). 
It does the following: 
- Create your root directory ETH3D/, create two sub-directories multiview_testing/ and multiview_training/
- Download the "Low rew multi-view, training data, all distorted images" [here](https://www.eth3d.net/data/multi_view_training_rig.7z) and unzip them in multiview_training/
- Download the "Low rew multi-view, testing data, all undistorted images" [here](https://www.eth3d.net/data/multi_view_test_rig_undistorted.7z) and unzip them in multiview_testing/
- We directly provide correspondences for pairs of images taken at different intervals. There is one bundle file for each dataset and each rate of interval, for example "lakeside_every_5_rate_of_3". 
This means that we sampled the source images every 5 images and the target image is taken at a particular rate from each source image. Download all these files [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Okqs5QYetgVu_HERS88DuvsABGak08iN/view?usp=sharing) and unzip them.

The organisation of your directories is important, since the bundle files contain the relative paths to the images, from the ETH3D root folder. 

<br /><br />
**Evaluation**: for each interval rate (3,5,7,9,11,13,15), we compute the metrics for each of the sub-datasets 
(lakeside, delivery area and so on). The final metrics are the average over all datasets for each rate. 
After updating the path of 'eth3d' in admin/local.py, evaluation is run with
```bash
python eval_matching.py --datasets robotcar --model PDCNet --pre_trained_models megadepth --optim_iter 3 --local_optim_iter 7 --save_dir path_to_save_dir PDCNet --multi_stage_type direct
```

PCK-1 for different rates of intervals between image pairs: 

Note that the PCKs are computed **per image**, and 
then averaged per sequence. The final metrics is the average over all sequences. It corresponds to the results 
'_per_image' in the outputted metric file. 
Note that this is not the metrics used in the [PDC-Net paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01710), where the PCKs are c
omputed **per sequence** instead, using the PDC-Net direct approach (corresponds to results '_per_dataset' 
in outputted metric file).

## 5. Training <a name="Training"></a>

### Quick Start

The installation should have generated a local configuration file "admin/local.py". 
In case the file was not generated, run 
```python -c "from admin.environment import create_default_local_file; create_default_local_file()"```to generate it. 
Next, set the paths to the training workspace, i.e. the directory where the model weights and checkpoints will be saved. 
Also set the paths to the datasets you want to use (and which should be downloaded beforehand, see below). 
If all the dependencies have been correctly installed, you can train a network using the run_training.py script 
in the correct conda environment.

```bash
conda activate dense_matching_env
python run_training.py train_module train_name
```

Here, train_module is the sub-module inside train_settings and train_name is the name of the train setting file to be used.

For example, you can train using the included default PDCNet_stage1 settings by running:
```bash
python run_training.py PDCNet PDCNet_stage1
```

### Training datasets downloading <a name="scanNet"></a>

<details>
  <summary><b>DPED-CityScape-ADE </b></summary>

This is the same image pairs used in [GLU-Net repo](https://github.com/PruneTruong/GLU-Net). 
For the training, we use a combination of the DPED, CityScapes and ADE-20K datasets. 
The DPED training dataset is composed of only approximately 5000 sets of images taken by four different cameras. 
We use the images from two cameras, resulting in around  10,000 images. 
CityScapes additionally adds about 23,000 images. 
We complement with a random sample of ADE-20K images with a minimum resolution of 750 x 750. 
It results in 40.000 original images, used to create pairs of training images by applying geometric transformations to them. 
The path to the original images as well as the geometric transformation parameters are given in the csv files
'assets/csv_files/homo_aff_tps_train_DPED_CityScape_ADE.csv' and 'assets/csv_files/homo_aff_tps_test_DPED_CityScape_ADE.csv'.

**Apparently, the structure of the ADE-20K dataset has changed and the provided paths in the csv files are not valid anymore**. 
I am working on a fix for the ADE-20K images. 
In the meantime, use 'assets/csv_files/homo_aff_tps_train_DPED_CityScape.csv' and 
'assets/csv_files/homo_aff_tps_test_DPED_CityScape.csv' to exclude the ADE images (you don't need to download the ADE-20K dataset in that case). 
Resulting training data is 31K images. Performance of the resulting trained model might be a bit different. 

 
1. Download the original images

* Download the [DPED dataset](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/) (54 GB) ==> images are created in original_images/
* Download the [CityScapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)
    - download 'leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip' (11GB, left 8-bit images - train, val, and test sets', 5000 images) ==> images are created in CityScape/
    - download leftImg8bit_trainextra.zip (44GB, left 8-bit images - trainextra set, 19998 images) ==> images are created in CityScape_extra/

* Download the [ADE-20K dataset](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/) (3.8 GB, 20.210 images) ==> images are created in ADE20K_2016_07_26/


Put all the datasets in the same directory. 
As illustration, your root training directory should be organised as follows:
```bash
training_datasets/
    ├── original_images/
    ├── CityScape/
    ├── CityScape_extra/
    └── ADE20K_2016_07_26/
```

2. Save the synthetic image pairs and flows to disk                
During training, from this set of original images, the pairs of synthetic images could be created on the fly at each epoch. 
However, this dataset generation takes time and since no augmentation is applied at each epoch, one can also create the dataset in advance
and save it to disk. During training, the image pairs composing the training datasets are then just loaded from the disk 
before passing through the network, which is a lot faster. 
To generate the training dataset and save it to disk: 

```bash
python assets/save_training_dataset_to_disk.py --image_data_path /directory/to/original/training_datasets/ 
--csv_path assets/homo_aff_tps_train_DPED_CityScape_ADE.csv --save_dir /path/to/save_dir --plot True
```    
It will create the images pairs and corresponding flow fields in save_dir/images and save_dir/flow respectively.

3. Add the paths in admin/local.py as 'training_cad_520' and 'validation_cad_520'

<details>
  <summary><b>COCO </b></summary>
  
This is useful for adding moving objects. 
Download the images along with annotations from [here](http://cocodataset.org/#download). The root folder should be
organized as follows. The add the paths in admin/local.py as 'coco'. 
```bash
coco_root
    └── annotations
        ├── instances_train2014.json
        └── instances_train2017.json
    └──images
        ├── train2014
        └── train2017
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary><b> MegaDepth </b></summary>
  
We use the reconstructions provided in the [D2-Net repo](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu/d2-net).
You can download the undistorted reconstructions and aggregated scene information folder directly 
[here - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hxpOsqOZefdrba_BqnW490XpNX_LgXPB). 

File structure should be the following:
```bash
MegaDepth
├── Undistorted_Sfm
└── scene_info
```

Them add the paths in admin/local.py as 'megadepth_training'.

### Training scripts 

The framework currently contains the training code for the following matching networks. 
The setting files can be used train the networks, or to know the exact training details.


**Warp Consistency**: TO COME 


<details>
  <summary><b>PDC-Net <a name="pdcnet"></a></b></summary>

* PDCNet.PDCNet_stage1: The default settings used for first stage network training with fixed backbone weights. 
We initialize the backbone VGG-16 with pre-trained ImageNet weights. We train first on synthetically generated image 
pairs from the DPED, CityScape and ADE dataset (pre-computed and saved), on which we add independently moving objects and perturbations. 

* PDCNet.PDCNet_stage2: The default settings used for training the final PDC-Net model. 
This setting fine-tunes all layers in the model trained using PDCNet_stage1 (including the feature backbone). As training
dataset, we use a combination of the same dataset than in stage 1 as well as image pairs from the MegaDepth dataset 
and their sparse ground-truth correspondence data. 

* PDCNet.GLUNet_GOCor_star_stage1: Same settings than for PDCNet_stage1, with different model (non probabilistic baseline). 
The loss is changed accordingly to the L1 loss instead of the negative log likelihood loss. 

* PDCNet.GLUNet_GOCor_star_stage2: The default settings used for training the final GLU-Net-GOCor* 
(see [PDCNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01710)). 

</details>


<details>
  <summary><b>GLU-Net <a name="glunet"></a></b></summary>

* GLUNet.GLUNet_static: The default settings used training the final GLU-Net (of the paper
 [GLU-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05524)).  
We fix the  backbone weights and initialize the backbone VGG-16 with pre-trained ImageNet weights. 
We train on synthetically generated image pairs from the DPED, CityScape and ADE dataset (pre-computed and saved),
which is later ([GOCor paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07823)) referred to as 'static' dataset. 

* GLUNet.GLUNet_dynamic: The default settings used training the final GLU-Net trained on the dynamic 
dataset (of the paper [GOCor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07823)).  
We fix the  backbone weights and initialize the backbone VGG-16 with pre-trained ImageNet weights. 
We train on synthetically generated image pairs from the DPED, CityScape and ADE dataset (pre-computed and saved), 
on which we add one independently moving object. 
This dataset is referred to as 'dynamic' dataset in [GOCor paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07823).

### Training your own networks

To train a custom network using the toolkit, the following components need to be specified in the train settings. 
For reference, see [GLUNet_static.py](https://github.com/PruneTruong/DenseMatching/train_settings/GLUNet/GLUNet_static.py).

* Datasets: The datasets to be used for training. A number of standard matching datasets are already available in 
the datasets module. The dataset class can be passed a processing function, which should perform the necessary 
processing of the data before batching it, e.g. data augmentations and conversion to tensors.
* Dataloader: Determines how to sample the batches. Can use specific samplers. 
* Network: The network module to be trained.
* BatchPreprocessingModule: The pre-processing module that takes the batch and will transform it to the inputs 
required for training the network. Depends on the different networks and training strategies. 
* Objective: The training objective.
* Actor: The trainer passes the training batch to the actor who is responsible for passing the data through the 
network correctly, and calculating the training loss. The batch preprocessing is also done within the actor class. 
* Optimizer: Optimizer to be used, e.g. Adam.
* Scheduler: Scheduler to be used. 
* Trainer: The main class which runs the epochs and saves checkpoints.
